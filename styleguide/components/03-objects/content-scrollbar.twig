            Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that
            required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more.
            This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent
            styles, but when you <em>really are</em> just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor
            in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.
        </p>
        <p>We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my <code>h1</code> elements? How do I disable this? What
                do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You
            don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a <code>p</code> element in a piece of your
            dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either â€” you want
            them to look <em>awesome</em>, not awful.
